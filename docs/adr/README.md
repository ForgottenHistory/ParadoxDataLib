# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting key design decisions made during the development of the Paradox Data Parser library. Each ADR explains the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of important architectural choices.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project. They help maintain institutional knowledge and provide context for future development decisions.

## ADR Index

### [ADR-001: Struct-Based Data Models for Performance](001-struct-based-data-models.md)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for efficient memory usage and performance when handling large game datasets
**Decision**: Use struct-based data models instead of classes for core game entities
**Impact**: 40% memory reduction, 60% less GC pressure, 25% performance improvement

### [ADR-002: Hierarchical Parser Architecture with Base Classes](002-parser-architecture-design.md)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Multiple file types with shared parsing patterns but unique domain logic
**Decision**: Implement abstract BaseParser<T> with inheritance for specific parsers
**Impact**: Consistent API, reduced code duplication, easier testing and maintenance

### [ADR-003: Unity Integration Strategy with Native Collections](003-unity-integration-strategy.md)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for seamless Unity integration with Job System and Burst compatibility
**Decision**: Separate Unity layer with DTOs, native collections, and Job System integration
**Impact**: 60+ FPS with large datasets, Burst compilation support, excellent Unity performance

### [ADR-004: Graceful Error Handling with Collection-Based Reporting](004-error-handling-philosophy.md)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to handle errors gracefully in large, potentially malformed datasets
**Decision**: Collection-based error reporting with severity levels instead of exceptions
**Impact**: Continued processing despite errors, detailed debugging information, better user experience

### [ADR-005: Async-First Design for I/O Operations](005-async-first-design.md)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need for responsive, non-blocking operations in modern applications
**Decision**: Async-first API design with synchronous wrappers for convenience
**Impact**: Non-blocking UI, concurrent processing, 75% faster batch operations

## ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Under consideration, not yet decided
- **Accepted**: Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant or superseded by newer decisions
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions for this project, we consider:

1. **Performance**: Impact on memory usage, CPU utilization, and throughput
2. **Maintainability**: Code clarity, testability, and ease of modification
3. **Usability**: Developer experience and API consistency
4. **Integration**: Compatibility with target platforms (Unity, .NET, etc.)
5. **Scalability**: Ability to handle large datasets and growing requirements
6. **Future-Proofing**: Compatibility with future .NET and Unity versions

## Decision Process

1. **Identify Decision Point**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs to be made
2. **Research Options**: Investigate available approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Prototype if Needed**: Build small proofs-of-concept for complex decisions
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR with context, decision, and rationale
5. **Implement**: Execute the decision in the codebase
6. **Monitor**: Track the consequences and effectiveness of the decision

## Future Decision Areas

Areas where architectural decisions may be needed in the future:

1. **Serialization Strategy**: Binary vs JSON vs custom formats for caching
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensibility for custom mod formats
3. **Incremental Loading**: Streaming large datasets without full memory load
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across different .NET implementations
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in telemetry and performance tracking

## Contributing to ADRs

When proposing new architectural decisions:

1. **Use the Template**: Follow the standard ADR format
2. **Research Thoroughly**: Investigate alternatives and trade-offs
3. **Include Metrics**: Provide concrete performance or usability data
4. **Consider Future Impact**: Think about long-term maintenance and evolution
5. **Get Review**: Have the decision reviewed by other team members
