# Paradox Data Parser Library - Development Guide

## Project Overview
Here's an expanded Project Overview section:

## Project Overview
The Paradox Data Parser Library is a high-performance, standalone C# library designed to parse and manage game data files from Paradox Interactive games (Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings III, Hearts of Iron IV, Victoria 3). Built as a .NET library, it provides a modern, efficient alternative to the aging Clausewitz engine's data handling, while maintaining full backwards compatibility with existing Paradox file formats and modding ecosystems.

The core philosophy behind this library is separation of concerns - by keeping the data parsing and management layer completely independent from Unity or any other game engine, we achieve multiple benefits. First, the library can be developed, tested, and optimized on any development machine without requiring Unity installation or licenses. Second, the codebase remains portable across different platforms and could theoretically be used in other game engines or tools. Third, unit testing and benchmarking become significantly easier when the data layer isn't entangled with engine-specific code. This approach also enables better collaboration, as developers can contribute to the data layer without needing knowledge of Unity's systems.

At its heart, the library addresses several key limitations of Paradox's current implementation. Where the Clausewitz engine loads all data into memory at startup (causing long load times), this library implements lazy loading and streaming for faster initial loads. Where Paradox games require full restarts for mod changes, this library provides hot-reloading capabilities for rapid iteration during development. Where the original engine uses older parsing techniques, this library leverages modern C# features like Span<T>, Memory<T>, and parallel processing to achieve superior performance. The goal is to handle 13,000+ provinces in under 5 seconds while using less than 500MB of RAM - a significant improvement over current Paradox load times.

Beyond just parsing, the library provides a complete data management solution. It includes a robust validation system to catch errors before they cause crashes, a string interning system to reduce memory usage for repeated values like cultures and religions, and a sophisticated cross-referencing system that maintains relationships between provinces, countries, and other game entities. The binary serialization layer allows for near-instant loading of previously processed data, while the mod support system enables seamless integration of community content without the file conflict issues that plague current Paradox titles. With built-in performance monitoring and debugging tools, modders gain unprecedented visibility into how their changes impact game performance, enabling them to create more optimized content.

## Key Design Decisions

### Memory Strategy
- **Structs vs Classes**: Use structs for data that's frequently accessed and under 64 bytes
- **String Interning**: Implement custom string pool for repeated values
- **Collections**: Use NativeCollections-compatible types for Unity integration

### Error Handling
- **Result Pattern**: Use Result<T> types instead of exceptions for parsing
- **Validation**: Two-phase validation (structural then semantic)
- **Recovery**: Support partial parsing with error collection

### Performance Goals
- **Load Time**: Target < 5 seconds for 13k provinces
- **Memory**: < 500MB for full world data in memory
- **Parallelization**: Use all cores for initial load

### Compatibility
- **Games**: EU4, CK3, HOI4, Victoria 3 formats
- **Versions**: Support latest stable version + 2 previous
- **Deprecated**: Maintain backwards compatibility with warnings

### API Design
- **Style**: Fluent API for configuration, traditional for parsing
- **Async**: Async by default with sync wrappers
- **Streaming**: Support both streaming and batch processing
